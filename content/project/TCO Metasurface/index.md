Almost all of tunable [metasurfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_metasurface) in optical wavelengths could only steer the beam in only one dimension (along x-axis OR y-axis). Here, I proposed a tunable metasurface that is capable of steering the beam in 2 directions (along x AND y axis). The speed and power consumption of this method is superior to PCM metasurfaces. However, the efficiency is significantly lower. The efficiency could be improved by using all-dielectric structures or using optimization methods.

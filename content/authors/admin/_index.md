Hi ðŸ‘‹! I'm Omid </br>
I am an Ph.D. student of applied physics in university of Jena. I got my master's degree in electrical engineering from [University of Tehran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tehran). My research interests include nano and quantum opics. I'm also interested in machine learning. During my studies, I gained experience in multiphysics simulations, scientific programming, and deep learning.

I'm  a graduate Student at the university of Tehran. My research interest are nanophotonics and artificial neural networks. I'm experienced in multiphysics simulations. Currently, I'm trying to design more efficinet and more precise optical devices with the help of novel optimization methods (e.g, deep learning). In a bigger picture, I dream about using artificial intelligence to make better devices in every aspect.

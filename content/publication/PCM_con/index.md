abstract: Metasurfaces are planar structures that enable us to manipulate electromagnetic wavefronts by using subwavelength elements. Here, we propose a new tunable metasurface based on phase change materials and graphene heaters to operate in the near-IR regime. In the proposed structure, by incorporating electrical heaters, the optical properties of the phase change material layer and, consequently, the metasurface response can be adjusted. Finally, to investigate the potential capability of the proposed metasurface as a free space beam shaper, its beam steering capability is investigated.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We showed beam steering capability of a novel phase change material based tunable metasurface.
